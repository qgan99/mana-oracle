//- add a clear button
//- maniputlate the json
// read the article on making a autocomplete form - what does autocomplete in html do - decided to go a different direction
  - autocomplete in hmtl autocomplete user's previous inputs. 
  - possibly make a robust search?
// filter set by type "expansion" to get only the relevant ones
// sort by date
// manabuttons work now
// solved problem with manabuttons resizing with the window
  // container needs to be set size
// stylize the mana buttons up and down- look at reddit for an example
  // svg for style? look into it
  // make svg unhilightable 

// remove unreleased sets 
// populated cards
// got cards from scyfall and sorted by flash/instant
// sorted cards by mana cost
// sorted cards by cmc
- make undo hoverable - stylize all buttons
- better understand async and promise
- get vs post, create a database with scryfall
- start populating cards
- caching data - THIS WILL BE A BIG ONE THAT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT AFTER FUNCTIONING
- add a modify total cmcm button?
  - change last one to be adjust cmc
- add a ? about button that when hovered explains how to use it.
  - make it hover over the rest of the ui
